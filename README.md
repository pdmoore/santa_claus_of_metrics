Examples of high code coverage percentages without actually covering all beahvior

The Gilded Rose UpdateQuality method can be 100% covered (line/statement, not branch) with 3 tests.

Examples in different languages
- java_0_tests - 3 tests will give 100% line coverage
- java_100_covered - many tests to achieve 100% branch coverage
- java_mutations - same 3 tests as java_0_tests to demo Pitest
- csharp_3_tests - 3 tests will give 100% statement coverage
- javascript-jest - same 3 tests
- python - same 3 tests
