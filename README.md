Examples of high code coverage percentages without actually covering all behavior

The Gilded Rose UpdateQuality method can be 100% covered with 3 tests (line/statement coverage, not branch coverage).

Examples in different languages
- java_0_tests - 3 tests will give 100% line coverage
- java_100_covered - many tests to achieve 100% branch coverage
- java_mutations - same 3 tests as java_0_tests to demo Pitest
- csharp_3_tests - 3 tests will give 100% statement coverage
- javascript-jest - same 3 tests
- python - same 3 tests


The three tests were chosen from the last unexecuted line of code in the method each time. They are:
- Aged Brie increase in quality after the sell date
- Backstage passes quality drops to zero after sell date
- Generic item quality decreases twice as fast after sell date
